# UI design with QT Designer
This version represents the basic framework of the application. Using QT Designer, the graphical user interface was created and converted into executable Python source code by pyuic6.<br/><br/>

As already described, I have oriented myself to the assembler masswerk (https://www.masswerk.at/6502/assembler.html.) for the creation of the graphical user interface.
