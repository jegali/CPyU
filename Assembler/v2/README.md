# The GUI version
Based on the experience with the disassembler module, I integrated the assembler function directly into the graphical user interface.

## The Interface
This user interface also has some quirks that I would like to discuss. The first thing to mention is that errors can occur during an assembly process, since a source code is translated into machine language. Unlike the disassembler, which translates executable code back, source code is usually created by a human and therefore there is always a certain probability that the code contains errors.
