# CPU
In this folder the emulation of the 6502 CPU is created. The subprojects [Disassembler](https://github.com/jegali/CPyU/tree/main/Disassembler) and [Assembler](https://github.com/jegali/CPyU/tree/main/Assembler) were only the first step towards the emulation.

I designed this module directly in Qt Designer without going through a console application. To emulate the CPU, I created another program window that can open the disassembler and assembler window if needed.
