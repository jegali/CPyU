# Standalone Emulation
The step-by-step emulation from V2 showed me where there were still bugs in the code, as Python pointed out the errors very elegantly and with extensive stacktrace. After I fixed these bugs and the emulation ran stable over many steps, I wrote a routine to run the emulation "by itself and all the time". There were no more error messages, however this approach is unfortunately too slow for a real emulation. Therefore I wrote this version.

## Time measurement
The original Apple ][ ran with a clock frequency of 1.020... MHz, so about 1 MHz. Conversely, this means that a timing signal (aka clock cycle) is generated a million times per second or - expressed the other way around - every microsecond. I wrote a timer which outputs the number of processed clock cycles per second for my pyQt application. It was far below the required 1 million - so I decided to abandon the graphical user interface and switch to pygame for the real-time simulation. By means of pygame - so I thought - I have also directly the possibility to write the screen module of the Apple and to realize the sound output.
