# The GUI version
The next step in the creation of the disassembler module was the integration of the command line version into a contemporary graphical user interface. For this the already presented user interface created in QT Designer was used. I made some changes to the source code of the disassembler, which will be discussed in the next sections.

## The Interface
The interface has all the features that I consider useful at the moment. There is a minimal hex-viewer at the top left, the possibility to load object or assembler files and - very important - the disassemble button. Depending on the selected function the output takes place with clock cycles, occupation and/or address mode.

So, pretty much of the functionality already shown on the command line can be found here.

## App structure
As already discussed, the application consists of two parts. There is the UI file generated by Qt Designer, which has been translated into python source text using pyuic. And there is the main.py file that starts the program.

Here are again the contents of the file main.py:

```bash
import sys

from PyQt6 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets

from disassemblerWindow import Ui_DisassemblerWindow


def main():
    app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)
    main = QtWidgets.QMainWindow()
    disasm = Ui_DisassemblerWindow()
    disasm.setupUi(main)
    main.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The class that encapsulates the graphical interface is named UI_DisassemblerWindow and is called from the program code of the main.py class.
